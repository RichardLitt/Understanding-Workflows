Components, pipes, blocks, JS pages and blocks of any kind are welcome, but we have a particular interest in blocks created under Popfly as it supports a convenient visual composition of component blocks.</span></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size: large; ><span style=font-weight: bold; >What are mashups?</span></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size: medium; ><span class=Apple-style-span>Bioinformatics analysis involves the use of many software tools and databases that are accessed through a variety of websites. Integration of these disparate resources is required for efficient analysis as one bioinformatics problem may require the use of a number of these different tools and databases. Mashups offer a new avenue for performing bioinformatics analysis.&nbsp; A mashup is a web application that combines data and services from multiple sources, and can therefore allow for the integration of various bioinformatics tools to perform a specific task efficiently.</span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size: medium; ><span class=Apple-style-span>A number of mashup frameworks are available: Google Mashups, Yahoo Pipes and Microsoft Popfly. The Popfly framework is based around a basic service unit termed a block. These blocks can be combined to form a mashup through a simple drag-and-drop mechanism, with connections being formed between the relevant blocks as required. Popfly is particularly convenient as a vehicle for re-use as once they are created, blocks can be shared with the bioinformatics community for reuse in other mashups as necessary.</span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size: large; ><span class=Apple-style-span style=font-weight: bold; >Popfly Blocks</span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size: medium; ><span class=Apple-style-span>A Popfly block makes use of a Javascript file, which provides methods for user generated code to invoke. It also has an associated XML manifest file which describes more about the block. Popfly blocks each perform a specific task within a mashup, receiving input either from the user, or from other blocks in a mashup and generating output which is either displayed, or passed to another block for further processing. Popfly blocks that we have developed for biomashups are available here, in the shared files for the BioMashups group, and are also available to registered users at Popfly. Block functions include user input blocks, blocks for displaying mashup results and bioinformatics processing blocks, which access bioinformatics data sources. Processing blocks can perform tasks such as retrieval of relevant information from a bioinformatics database (egs GenBank or UniProt) and accessing prediction tools, such as those which predict functional or structural characteristics of a protein. Example blocks include:</span></span></p><ol style=margin-top:0cm><li style=text-align:justify;><span style=font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial>User      Input Protein: receives input from the user in the form of either a      Uniprot protein ID or a protein sequence</span></li><li style=text-align:justify;><span style=font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial>Protein      Characteristics: takes a protein ID as input and returns information about      the protein from the Uniprot database. <span style=mso-spacerun:yes>&nbsp;</span></span></li><li style=text-align:justify;><span style=font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial>Blast:      makes a protein sequence comparison using Blast and provides a protein ID      for the highest match.</span></li><li style=text-align:justify;><span style=font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial>SignalP:      takes a protein sequence as input.

The proposed e-lab will comprise three layers: the e-science and data mining layers will form a generic research environment that can be adapted to different scientific domains by customizing the application layer.</p><p>The e-science layer, built on an open-source e-science infrastructure developed by one of the partners, will support content creation through collaboration at multiple scales and degrees of commitment &mdash; ranging from small, contract-bound teams to voluntary, constraint-free participation in dynamic virtual communities.</p><p>The data mining layer will be the distinctive core of e-LICO; it will provide comprehensive multimedia (structured records, text, images, signals) data mining tools. Standard tools will be augmented with preprocessing or learning algorithms developed specifically to meet challenges of data-intensive, knowledge rich sciences, such as ultra-high dimensionality or undersampled data. Methodologically sound use of these tools will be ensured by a knowledge-driven data mining assistant, which will rely on a data mining ontology and knowledge base to plan the mining process and propose ranked workflows for a given application problem. Extensive e-lab monitoring facilities will automate the accumulation of experimental meta-data to support replication and comparison of data mining experiments. These meta-data will be used by a meta-miner, which will combine probabilistic reasoning with kernel-based learning from complex structures to incrementally improve the assistant's workflow recommendations.</p><p>e-LICO will be showcased in a systems biology task: biomarker discovery and molecular pathway modelling for diseases affecting the kidney and urinary pathways.</p></div>","Monday 16 November 2009 @ 08:24:00 (GMT)","elico","http://www.myexperiment.org/users/4533, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/12516, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/15031, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/8674, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/14986, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/8673, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/3583, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/13545, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/13255, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/12462, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/11173, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/10613, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/9351, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/9312, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/8621, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/8365, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/7695, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/7825, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/7752, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/7821, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/7800, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/1384, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/267, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/30, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/6938, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/20, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/25, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/4632, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/4634, ","http://www.myexperiment.org/users/4533","1","http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/627, http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/1683, ","data mining, kup, ","2011-11-05 15:04:19.527090",

The scale of the information that users eventually want to share and access is generally larger than will fit into a single triple store. Also, it is impossible to centralize all knowledge in a CWA knowledge warehouse. For this reason, federation of data sources will be necessary in order to reach the goals of CWA. Such techniques are being developed in the HCLS Interest Group and can be applied in the context of CWA Storage. This group also needs to keep track of the latest practical limits of triple stores: How many triples can be stored in a given type of repository and what types of queries and reasoning are possible as a result? As a first step towards supporting life science knowledge exchange, we would like to provide programmatic (SPARQL) access to a triple representation of one of the most important bioinformatics resources on the Web: Uniprot. Uniprot already has triples exported as RDF files and has documented the challenge of processing them within a release cycle in the SWAT4LS poster called &quot;Weekend Triple Billionaire&quot;.</span></p></div>","Friday 27 November 2009 @ 19:39:12 (GMT)","","http://www.myexperiment.org/users/14, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/37, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/2650, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/5599, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/2213, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/2627, ","http://www.myexperiment.org/users/14","1","http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/1499, http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/1701, http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/607, http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/907, http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/1247, ","cwa, hcls, rdf, repository, semantic web, ","2011-11-05 15:05:26.144246",

A nano-publication contains a single 'unit of though', and minimal provenance about who made it, where it was stated, how many times it was stated, etc. The focus of the Content Capture group is on capturing these nano-publications from existing data repositories, and while individual scientists perform (computational) experiments.</p><p>The proposed role of our group is mediator of the capture process itself in the 'content capture pipeline': (i) data repositories are suggested by the CWA Content Acquisition group, (ii) we assess with other experts in CWA and the provider if/how to make the public information available conform the Concept Web format, (iii) together with the acquisition group we reprioritise their list, (iv) we guide the process of capturing. Our activity is related to at least CWA groups 2.6 (nano-publication format), 2.2 (tool development), 2.3 (storage and maintenance), and 2.8 (content acquisition). Especially the formatting activity also links to W3C Health Care and Life Science Interest Group, in particular their 'Scientific Discourse' task force.</p><p>Please consider requesting membership of this group, for instance because (i) you think you can mediate between content owners, triple producers, and triple tool developers, (ii) help find ways to capture content for and by application scientists, (iii) you think this is all wrong and want to play devil's advocate.

Have views in WikiPeople (under <b>+co-authors</b>) in separate columns that shows whether a given person in that list has authorized its page, and whether that person is registered in MyExperiment (making the person contactable via MyExperiment.</span></p><p><span>3. Develop a matching algorithm to automatically suggest workflows, files, packs, groups and people of interest, based on accumulated concept profiles of these categories in MyExperiment. Each workflow, service <a href=http://www.biocatalogue.org/>from Bio-Catalogue</a> and the like would have to be tagged. If a person registers for instance with 5 proteins and several proteomics related concepts in their profile, they would be presented with this <a href=http://www.biocatalogue.org/search?q=proteomics&amp;commit=>list form Bio-Catalogue</a>.</span></p>&lt;/meta>&lt;/meta>&lt;/meta>&lt;/meta></div>","Monday 17 August 2009 @ 13:15:03 (BST)","","http://www.myexperiment.org/users/2213, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/2729, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/2646, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/2768, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/22, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/2690, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/13, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/18, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/25, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/2611, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/2635, http://www.myexperiment.org/users/16, ","http://www.myexperiment.org/users/2213","1","","","2011-11-05 15:08:50.237421",
