The workflow requires an input of: a chromosome name or number; a QTL start base pair position; QTL end base pair position. Data is then extracted from BioMart to annotate each of the genes found in this region. The Entrez and UniProt identifiers are then sent to KEGG to obtain KEGG gene identifiers. The KEGG gene identifiers are then used to searcg for pathways in the KEGG pathway database.","chromosome, data-driven, disease, ensembl, entrez, gene, genes, genotype, kegg, mouse, nbiconworkflows, pathway, pathway-driven, pathways, phenotype, qtl, shim, subworkflow, uniprot","9642","3959","http://127.0.0.1:8888/Notebook/myexp/16/statistics","9677","3975","3296","550","2746","619","106","513","6381","3356","1","0","19","7","7","1","0","6","1","1","1","3","0","1","8","1","0","chromosome_name, start_position, end_position, ","regex_2, kegg_pathway_release, pathway_descriptions, gene_descriptions, binfo, Kegg_gene_ids, flatten_pathway_files, Kegg_gene_ids_2, remove_nulls_3, remove_Nulls, REMOVE_NULLS_2, split_gene_ids, remove_pathway_nulls_2, remove_pathway_nulls, add_uniprot_to_string, add_ncbi_to_string, genes_in_qtl, mmusculus_gene_ensembl, create_report, split_for_duplicates, merge_reports, merge_pathway_list_1, merge_uniprot_ids, split_for_duplicate_pathways, remove_entrez_duplicates, remove_duplicate_ids, remove_duplicate_kegg_genes, remove_pathway_duplicates, merge_pathway_list_2, merge_kegg_references, merge_pathway_desc, merge_entrez_genes, merge_gene_desc, merge_genes_and_pathways_2, merge_genes_and_pathways, merge_genes_and_pathways_3, merge_patwhay_ids, remove_uniprot_duplicates, concat_kegg_genes, Get_pathways, ","Get_pathways, ","","1","20","2","9","5","0","1","1","2","remove_nulls_3, remove_Nulls, REMOVE_NULLS_2, split_gene_ids, remove_pathway_nulls_2, remove_pathway_nulls, add_uniprot_to_string, add_ncbi_to_string, create_report, concat_gene_pathway_ids, concat_ids, ","merged_pathways, gene_descriptions, pathway_descriptions, kegg_pathway_release, report, kegg_external_gene_reference, pathway_ids, genes_pathways, ",
