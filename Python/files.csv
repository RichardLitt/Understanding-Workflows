Put this file in the &quot;lib/security&quot; of your java installation. In case you have multiple java installations, you can decide to place it in all installations. Otherwise, you have to determine which installation taverna uses.<br />(In Windows, you can do this with &quot;set JAVA_HOME&quot;, in linux, &quot;echo $JAVA_HOME&quot;)</li><li>Before you can start services provided by <a href=http://www.bioinformatics>www.bioinformatics</a>, you possibly have to restart Taverna.</li><li>Good luck</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Copyright 2006 Sun Microsystems, Inc.&nbsp; All Rights Reserved.</b></p><p><br />Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:<br />&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.</li><li>Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.</li><li>Neither the name of Sun Microsystems nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.<br />&nbsp;</li></ul><p>THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS IS&quot; AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.&nbsp; IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT OWNER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>","http://www.myexperiment.org/files/148/download/InstallCert.jar","http://www.myexperiment.org/users/622","Wassinki","<p>This File islicensed under: <br /><br /><a rel="Copyright" href="http://www.myexperiment.org/licenses/2" title="Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License"><img src="/images/by-sa.png" /></a></p>","Wassinki","http://www.myexperiment.org/users/622","http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/1173, http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/1171, http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/1172, http://www.myexperiment.org/tags/1170, ","certificates, https, keystore, ssl, ","Package: mapping oligonucleotides to an assembly","http://www.myexperiment.org/packs/45","http://127.0.0.1:8888/Notebook/myexp/files148/statistics","17","6","5","3","2","5","4","1","12","1",
