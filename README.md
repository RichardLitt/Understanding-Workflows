# README
This code was generated as part of a DataONE internship (see http://notebooks.dataone.org/workflows for more details)

* The python scripts scrape content from the myExperiment website (http://www.myexperiment.org/).
* The R scripts mostly generate figures from those data which are stored in a mysql database. Data will be made available upon project completion.
